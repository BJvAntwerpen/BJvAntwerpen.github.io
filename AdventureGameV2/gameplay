	DAY 2:
		Help move to New Home (help packing things, help Frisk adjust)[if 'help packing things' is done before 'help Frisk adjust', player loses a bonus + slightly different text/actions from Frisk]{when player is done with either 'quests' continue to //AFTERNOON//}.
	//AFTERNOON// [Actions change the time. Certain actions can only be done on certain days/times]
	QUESTS:
		Help bake a pie: chose between Snail Pie or Butterscotch-Cinnamon Pie.
			Snail Pie: Asriel's fav. Frisk doesn't eat it if [help_frisk_adjust == false] but if [help_frisk_adjust == true] says ?'has an acquired taste.'? Gives quest GetSnails
			Butterscotch-Cinnamon Pie: normal. Asriel sad but thinks that it's better for Frisk[helps frisk adjust more]. Gives quest ShoppingTime
		GetSnails: help get snails for Toriel's Snail Pie. Bought at snail farm near area == 'Blooky_House'. costs 25G (gained from Toriel)
		ShoppingTime: help get sugar and cinnamon for the ButtsPie. 2 diff shops (Snowdin[cinnamon], waterfall[sugar]). costs 60G total (gained from Toriel [20G cinnamon, 40G sugar]).
