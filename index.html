<h2 class="center">My description</h2>
<p>My goal with this portfolio is to make it as good as I can during the first year of my education. Besides that, I also want to pass the exams for this education.
I'm not certain what I want to do after this education. One of the things that I'm thinking about of doing after this, is going to NHTV in Breda (programming games). The other thing is doing some more programming (I'm thinking about programming apps for android or mods for minecraft (both of them are in Java)) so I can become better at it. When I'm better at programming and I didn't go to NHTV, I might go to NHTV to start to learn how to program games.<br>
What I like to do in my spare time is: watch clips on youtube and play games with my friends (my favorite game is OVERWATCH).</p>

<h2 class="center">Knowledge and skills</h2>
<p><img src="img/chemistry_joke_1.jpg" width="150" height="150">One of my skills is that I learn things quickly and I understand things quicker than I learn it. I have little knowledge of programming but I'm learning how to programm. This was completely new for me and I understand how it works and what to do.<br>
I would like to learn some other programming languages for example: javascript, C# and PHP (more languages is always usefull). I'm very good at maths and I have done physics, chemistry and biology.<br></p>
